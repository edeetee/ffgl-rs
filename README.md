# Support

- Windows and macOS !!!
- FFGL 2 (resolume)
- VDMX 5 (Currently broken)
- ISF Shader validation and quick compilation to FFGL plugin

Please get in contact with me at [vis@edt.nz](mailto:vis@edt.nz) if you have any questions!

# Functionality

- Logging inside resolume
- Handy scripts to build and run inside resolume
- Example ISF plugin
  - Give an input ISF file and output an FFGL plugin
  - Quicker than using Wire for basic ISF shaders
- Compile error for invalid ISF code
- GLSL translation

# Issues

## Please submit any issues you find to the [issues page](https://github.com/edeetee/ffgl-rs/issues)

## Known issues:

VDMX 5 is currently broken

<details>
<summary>Using a #define macro outside global scope is not supported</summary>

### From the glsl parser changelog:

### 0.13

> Wed 21st of November 2018

[...]

- The `#define` preprocessor pragma is now supported in a limited form (it can only be used in
  the global scope).

</details>

# Setup

## macOS

1. Install [rust](https://www.rustup.rs/): `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
2. Install xcode build tools: `xcode-select --install`
3. May need to accept the xcode license: `sudo xcodebuild -license`

## Windows

1. Install [rust](https://www.rustup.rs/): `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
2. Install the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
3. ??? Maybe other steps? It worked on my Windows 10 machine but I haven't tested it on a fresh windows install.

# Usage

## ISF

I have mostly used this to create ISF plugins.

#### Debug ISF on Resolume Arena

This script intelligently finds the isf file you're talking about and runs it.
It will automatically add RUST_LOG parameters to filter for the specific isf file you're working on.

`ffgl_run_resolume.sh <isf_file\name>`

The following command will take an ISF file, compile it to a plugin and deploy it to the system plugin folder. It is a good example of the steps required to make a plugin work.

`ffgl-isf/deploy_isf.sh <isf_file>`

#### Bulk script

There also a bulk version of the script that will deploy all the ISF files in the example_isf folder and some from the system ISF directory.
`ffgl-isf/bulk_deploy_isf.sh`
Add the `-e` flag to only print the compilation errors.

## General purpose scripts

### Deploy

Once a plugin has been built, it needs to be deployed to the system FFGL directory. On macos, it needs to be packaged as a 'Bundle' (A fancy folder).
`deploy_bundle.sh <output_lib_name>`

### Run

`./resolume.sh`
or
`./vdmx.sh`

### Validating ISF

use the `ffgl-isf/validate_isf.sh` script to validate an ISF file. It will print out any errors in the code.

### Change log level

I have integrated [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html) into the plugin. To change the log level you can set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. For example to set the log level to trace you can run

`RUST_LOG=trace ./resolume.sh`

The logs have structured data relating to your plugin:

- name: the name of the plugin
- id: the unique id of the plugin
- fn: the function enum that is being called
- in: the input data as int

See `ffgl_run_resolume.sh` for an advanced example of how to filter the logs to only show the plugin you are working on.

## Extending

### ffgl-core

You can create your own plugin from scratch by either using the SimpleFFGLInstance trait, or implement both the FFGLHandler and FFGLInstance traits.

You must call the ffgl_handler!() macro to associate your plugin with the correct entry points.

### ffgl-glium

Use this to create a glium instance while inside an ffgl plugin

### ffgl-isf

Use this to create an isf plugin. Needs more work to be modular.

# Future work

- Get working on Windows
- Embed any linked photos into the dylib along with the ISf source
- Handle multiple passes ✔️
- Label inputs
- String inputs

# Aims

I want a simple wrapper to make plugins for VJ programs such as resolume and present the user a basic GL context that can be used however you want for fun &advanced FX/Sources. This could be a good starting point for other connections (Connect to a touchdesigner instance that can automatically pause and swap between COMPs)
